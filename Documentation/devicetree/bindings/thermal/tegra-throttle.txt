Tegra thermal throttle devicetree bindings

This device is used for thermal throttle, and has number of properties.

Required properties:
- compatible:	Should be "nvidia,balanced-throttle".
- clocks:	Must be the core shared clocks.
		Should contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
		See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names:	core shared clocks, should be:
		cap.throttle.c3bus, cap.throttle.sclk, cap.throttle.emc
- balanced-states	phandle of the balanced throttle state.

====throttle state====
Required properties:
- cpu-freq:	the limit of cpu freq (in KHz) in this throttle state.
Optional properties:
- gpu-freq:	the limit of gpu freq (in KHz) in this throttle state.
		if omitted, it mean no limits for it.
- c3bus-freq:	the limit of c3bus freq (in KHz) in this throttle state.
		if omitted, it mean no limits for it.
- sclk-freq:	the limit of sclk freq (in KHz) in this throttle state.
		if omitted, it mean no limits for it.
- emc-freq:	the limit of emc freq (in KHz) in this throttle state.
		if omitted, it mean no limits for it.

Example:
tj-temperature-throttling {
	compatible = "nvidia,balanced-throttle";
	clocks = <&tegra_car 418>, <&tegra_car 429>, <&tegra_car 459>;
	clock-names = "cap.throttle.c3bus", "cap.throttle.sclk", "cap.throttle.emc";
	balanced-states = <&{/cpu-throttling-state}>;
};

cpu-throttling-state {
	throt-state@0 {
		cpu-freq = <739500>;
		gpu-freq = <550000>;
	};
	throt-state@1 {
		cpu-freq = <714000>;
		c2bus-freq = <555000>;
	};
};
