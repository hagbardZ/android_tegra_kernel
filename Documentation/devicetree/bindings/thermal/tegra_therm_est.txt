Thermal estimator driver.
This driver is used to estimate temperature based on the weighted
sum of a sequence of readings from other sensors.

Required properties:
 - compatible:	"nvidia,tegra124-therm-est".
 - toffset:	Temperature offset for thermal estimation, in milli-celsius.
 - polling-period: Polling wait times for thermal estimation, in milli-seconds.
 - sub-devs:	A sub-node which is a container of devices which
		used to estimate temperature.

Properties in sub-devs node:
 - dev:	device node of the thermal zone device, which the thermal estimation
	based on.
 - coeffs:	An array of coefficients, which are for the history twenty
		temperatures of the thermal zones, so the number of entries
		should be twenty.

Example:
	skin_temp: therm-est {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra124-therm-est";
		toffset = <9793>;
		polling-period = <1100>;

		#thermal-sensor-cells = <0>;

		sub-devs {
			dev0 {
				dev = <&diode>;
				coeffs = <2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 -1 -7>;
			};

			dev1 {
				dev = <&board>;
				coeffs = <-11 -7 -5 -3 -3 -2 -1 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 3 4 6 11 18>;
			};
		};
	};
