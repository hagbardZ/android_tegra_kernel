System-EDP Reactive Capping:

It periodically monitors how often SOC_THERM is throttling,
if too often, it can request more power for itself.

Required properties:
- compatible: "nvidia,tegra124-sysedp-reactive-capping"
- nvidia,max-capping-mw: This defines the maximum allowed power for this consumer
  in milliwatts.
- nvidia,step-alarm-mw: When the interrupt is triggered, increase the consumer's
  power by this amount in milliwatts.
- nvidia,step-relax-mw: After relax_ms time since the last interrupt has fired,
  reduce this consumer's required power by this amount in milliwatts.
- nvidia,relax_ms: This defines the delay in milliseconds after an interrupt
  triggers before relaxing this consumer's power requirements.
- interrupt-parent: This points to the parent device that will own the
  translation of the interrupt lines.
- interrupts: This provides the mapping to the parent which will translate
  the interrupt into the virtual irq value and flags used by
  request_threaded_irq(). Only 1 interrupt (2 values) should be defined.
- sysedpc,name: This is the name of the sysedp consumer defined

Example:
	sysedp_reactive_capping@1 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra124-sysedp-reactive-capping";
		nvidia,max-capping-mw = <15000>;
		nvidia,step-alarm-mw = <1000>;
		nvidia,step-relax-mw = <500>;
		nvidia,relax-ms = <250>;
		interrupt-parent = <&soctherm>;
		interrupts = <1 0x2002>;

		sysedpc,name = "voltmon_oc1";
	};
