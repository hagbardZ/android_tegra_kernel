* NAND driver for MT29F, GD5F and similar serial NAND flash chips

Required properties:
- #address-cells, #size-cells : Must be present if the device has sub-nodes
  representing partitions.
- compatible : Should be the manufacturer and the name of the chip. Bear in mind
               the DT binding is not Linux-only, but in case of Linux, see the
               "spi_nand_id_table" array in drivers/mtd/spi-nand/spi-nand-devices.c
               for the list of supported chips.
- reg : Chip-Select number
- spi-max-frequency : Maximum frequency of the SPI bus the chip can operate at

Example:

	flash: flash@0 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "gigadevice,gd5f";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <40000000>;
	};
